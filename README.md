# Multithreading Matrix Multiplication

## Overview
This project demonstrates the effect of multithreading on matrix multiplication tasks. By leveraging Python's `threading` module, the program performs matrix multiplication using multiple threads, allowing for potentially faster execution times compared to sequential execution.

## Features
- Generates a list of 100 matrices, each with a size of 100x100.
- Utilizes multithreading to divide matrix multiplication tasks among different threads.
- Measures and records the execution time for varying numbers of threads.
- Plots a graph showing the relationship between the number of threads and the execution time.
- Provides insights into the performance benefits of multithreading for matrix multiplication.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library for plotting the results.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `main.py` script.
4. View the output results and the generated graph.

## Results
